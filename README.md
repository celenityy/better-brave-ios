# better-brave-ios

My recommendations for the ultimate configuration of the Brave Browser on iOS :)

**NOTE:** This is specifically tailored for Brave on iOS. For Desktop, see [here](https://codeberg.org/celenity/better-brave), and for Android, see [here](https://codeberg.org/celenity/better-brave-android).

**NOTE:** This project can be found on both [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/celenity/better-brave-ios), which will act as the main & preferred way to contribute, and [GitHub](https://github.com/celenityy/better-brave-ios).

# Additional recommendations

* Follow my iOS settings [here](https://codeberg.org/celenity/ios-settings).

* Use a private, secure, & reputable DNS provider of your choice. I would recommend setting up your own [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io/) configuration if you are able to *(See my recommendations for NextDNS [here](https://codeberg.org/celenity/nextdns-settings))*, otherwise I would recommend [Quad9](https://quad9.net/).

* Enable [Lockdown Mode](https://support.apple.com/105120).

* Use a (reputable) VPN. I would recommend either [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/) or [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/).
